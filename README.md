# Bookmark-Organizer
Python 2.7 script that takes your bookmarks and puts them into a folder that are associated with that website.

In order to use the script, you will need the HTML file that was created by your browser. To obtain an HTML file of your bookmarks in Firefox 52.0.2, hit CTRL+SHIFT+O. The keyboard shortcut changed in Firefox 58.0.1 so you will have to hit CTRL+SHIFT+B. 

This will open a window called Library and lists all of your bookmarks. In that window, there will be a drop down titled 'Import and Backup' and inside of it, there would be a button to exporting your bookmarks to HTML.

Currently, I have tested this for Firefox 52.0.2 and Firefox 58.0.2
